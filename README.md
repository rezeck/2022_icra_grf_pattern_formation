# Chemistry-Inspired Pattern Formation with Robotic Swarms
## 2022 IEEE RA-L with ROS

Dynamic Gibbs random field applied to swarm morphogenesis abstracting chemical binding mechanism.


```Self-organized emergent patterns can be widely seen in particle interactions producing complex structures such as chemical elements and molecules. Inspired by these interactions, this work presents a novel stochastic approach that allows a swarm of heterogeneous robots to create emergent patterns in a completely decentralized fashion and relying only on local information. Our approach consists of modeling the swarm configuration as a dynamic Gibbs Random Field (GRF) and setting constraints on the neighborhood system inspired by chemistry rules that dictate binding polarity between particles. Using the GRF model, we determine velocities for each robot, resulting in behaviors that lead to the emergence of patterns or shapes. Simulated experiments show the versatility of the approach in producing a variety of patterns, and experiments with a group of physical robots show the feasibility in potential applications.```
